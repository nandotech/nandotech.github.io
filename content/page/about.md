subtitle: Who am I and where did I come from?
---

My name is Fernando Rodriguez. I am the Founder & CEO of NandoTech Inc, where we specialize in customized software development work for businesses of all shapes and sizes.  Beyond custom and software development work, we have also developed a fairly strong portfolio of VoIP customers ranging from small office phone systems to large-scale call center capablities.

I have an deep love for Clean Code and strive for many of the same principles applied by giants who started long before us.  I believe in iterating quickly and working closely with customers to achieve a shared goal.

Much of what I'm rambling on about, you can read more about in [The Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) and what have probably become my two favorite books: [Clean Code by Robert C. Martin](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) and [Scrum by Kent Beck & Jeff Sutherland](https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/038534645X) that have deeply help shape my views and experiences in software development.

I began writing HTML & JavaScript and made awesome (read: brightly colored with flashing backgrounds) websites in my early teen years and my love affair with computers took off.  It would be a while yet, but around 2006 at Florida Atlantic University I was first exposed to C and algorithms.

I fell in love all over again.  Next came C++. Then Data Structures.  I couldn't get enough.

Fortunately for all of us, I am now heavily invested in C# and absolutely love the [ASP.NET](https://dot.net) stack.  I consider myself an extremely competent web developer and also a polyglot.  There is something about programming especially and solving problems that completely transcends all programming languages and technology stacks 

_Beyond that_, welcome to my blog.  A diary of productivity, legwork, technical decisions, and the reasoning behind them as we build up our development shop.
