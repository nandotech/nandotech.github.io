## It has been a little while since our last post, 

and though I am currently working on a long _awesome_ post that should help out a ton of people (about halfway done), it was feeling lonely and quiet over here.

So, without any further adieu:

**_Octocat Pumpkin_** carved with <3 by [NandoTech's](http://www.nandotech.com) VP of Technology [@ArronMayers](https://twitter.com/arronmayers) in honor of the [GitHub](https://www.github.com) [Octocat](https://octodex.github.com/)

In case you're wondering, the upcoming post will cover Building an API with [.Net Core](http://dot.net), [NancyFX 2.0](http://www.nancyfx.org) and [Dapper.NET](https://github.com/stackexchange/dapper-dot-net). I will also try and cover some basic Nancy concepts and how it and [ASP.NET](http://asp.net) differ, as well as why I like Nancy so much.
