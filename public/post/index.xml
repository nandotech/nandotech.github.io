      <title>Networking Woes</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Let me start off by saying unequivocally and without any shadow of a doubt: I am not a networking expert.  Although I understand all the constructs of the web and most all of the requisite information pertaining to how computers and the internet communicate as well as the nuances of local and public networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My real deep protocol knowledge extends mostly into the realm of software development and how bits/bytes are consumed over the wire. I, for one, found it &lt;em&gt;absolutely fascinating&lt;/em&gt; how &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dot.net&#34;&gt;.NET team&lt;/a&gt; built the kestrel http server. There is an awesome video where &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/damianedwards&#34;&gt;Damian Edwards&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/172009499&#34;&gt;discusses it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, however, is a discussion slated for another day. Truly fascinating though how they&amp;rsquo;ve basically chosen to look at any given http request like a sequence of &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; values to avoid &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; allocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I digress, Today is mainly about 2 things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Venting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping guide anyone who is running into the same/similar issues with Comcast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Venting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html&#34;&gt;(Lest we forget one of the hardest problems in Computer Science&amp;ndash;Off By One errors)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comcast-default-behavior&#34;&gt;Comcast Default Behavior&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to get on with it: naturally the Comcast modem default behavior is to be extremely confusing. Our public, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ipchicken.com&#34;&gt;static IP&lt;/a&gt; address from &lt;a href=&#34;http://comcast.com&#34;&gt;Comcast&lt;/a&gt; here is &lt;code&gt;96.xxx.xxx.9&lt;/code&gt; (blocking some for safety/privacy).  One might expect the Comcast firewall to show this IP with the .10 Gateway, or something similar.  Instead, we get this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nandotech.github.io/img/comcast_ip.png&#34; alt=&#34;Comcast IP&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case anyone missed that: for some reason I am unable to explain, if you have purchased a static IP or a group of IP&amp;rsquo;s from Comcast your router actually gives off your &lt;strong&gt;Default Gateway&lt;/strong&gt; as your &lt;em&gt;Public IP&lt;/em&gt; and your Comcast  Business Router will have a &lt;em&gt;Default Gateway&lt;/em&gt; referencing some other point or thing on their network (presumably where, in this case, our /30 routes through).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several visits and phone calls with Comcast, no engineer was able to reliably explain it to me either.  I&amp;rsquo;ve moved on to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://media2.giphy.com/media/hIavT8NX1SE4E/200.gif&#34;&gt;acceptance stage of my grief&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-your-own-router&#34;&gt;Setting up your own Router&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, this seemingly small thing has an interesting and convenient side effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since none of the public IP&amp;rsquo;s are in use, any new router you may want to plug in on the inside of it can use &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of your available static IP addresses and the Comcast modem is able to stay up and 100% functioning if you so choose (to partition your network, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is where it gets confusing, especially for me&amp;ndash;this is because very often we are being dragged into an environment that we are not familiar with, did not set up, and/or there is no one available with the technical information (static IP range, subnet mask, etc) you actually need to set it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, you always run the risk of receiving bad information from Comcast should you decide to call for information (Has happened to me, &lt;em&gt;more than once&lt;/em&gt;!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sidebar-which-router&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sidebar: Which Router?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an FYI, the router referenced and used in the specific configuration shown here is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/MikroTik-CRS125-24G-1S-RM-rackmount-enclosure-manageable/dp/B00I4QJSIM&#34;&gt;Mikrotik Cloud Router Switch CRS125-24G&lt;/a&gt; which is also available in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://routerboard.com/CRS125-24G-1S-IN&#34;&gt;Non-Rackmount Version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much more extreme loads, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/MikroTik-Cloud-Core-Router-1009-8G-1S-1S/dp/B00KVFLKHG&#34;&gt;Mikrotik Cloud Core Router 1009-8G-1S+&lt;/a&gt; is recommended.  (&lt;em&gt;NOTE: This particular version requires much more granular setup &amp;amp; understanding of some networking beyond the scope of this article to complete setup&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you do have the correct information, here is an example of how the network referenced above is set:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nandotech.github.io/img/mikrotik-comcast-setup.png&#34; alt=&#34;Mikrotik Setup&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see and would expect, your &lt;em&gt;static IP&lt;/em&gt; and correct &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aelius.com/njh/subnet_sheet.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;subnet mask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (in this case, /30) need to be in the WAN IP Address field (this may differ or have a different name in other routers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;default gateway&lt;/em&gt; which the Comcast router uses as its IP, in turn, should be the &lt;em&gt;Gateway&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We choose to utilize &lt;a href=&#34;http://google.com&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://opendns.com&#34;&gt;OpenDNS&lt;/a&gt; public DNS servers rather than Comcast&amp;rsquo;s usual defaults of &lt;code&gt;75.75.75.75&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;75.75.76.76&lt;/code&gt;, though in some cases using the defaults helps to avoid some issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wrapping-it-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping It Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned before; if you follow the strategy outlined above you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to set up your new router/firewall inside of the Comcast network, utilize any one of your static IP addresses as a public, and all the while leave the Comcast Router up &amp;amp; running/functioning perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For security reasons, I personally turned off just about every single feature &amp;amp; network available on the default Comcast box once I got our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mikrotik.com&#34;&gt;Mikrotik&lt;/a&gt; working properly. This includes turning off all DHCP &amp;amp; Wireless on the Comcast modem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, I can actually get to &lt;code&gt;10.1.10.1&lt;/code&gt; (Comcast Router Default IP) while on my other local network of &lt;code&gt;192.168.88.xxx&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While convenient, once you have your firewall/router properly configured inside of your Comcast box, you should have very little reason to ever need to log into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your other option is if you want to partition your network into different &amp;ldquo;areas&amp;rsquo;, you could easily utilize both your Mikrotik Firewall network &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; your Comcast Firewall network in tandem even if you have only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; static IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Comcast Firewall will broadcast your &lt;em&gt;Gateway IP&lt;/em&gt; while your own Firewall will broadcast your assigned &lt;em&gt;Static IP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting Started with AngularJS 1.x</title>
      <link>https://nandotech.github.io/post/2016-06-11-getting-started-angularjs/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently took the Pluralsight course AngularJS: Get Started by Scott Allen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want the tl;dr early, it’s totally worth it and really starts to give you a pretty decent working knowledge of AngularJS, and what’s better yet: you build an actual working application in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did my own tweaks with the UI, minor deviations as well as selecting my own theme, but otherwise it’s pretty cool to see just how easy it is to create beautiful AngularJS apps tied to an API that turns standard JSON responses with little heavy lifting. Powerful built-in data binding and directives like ng-repeat have me sold on Angular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out my Plunker with the working “Github Viewer” application. &lt;a href=&#34;http://plnkr.co/vmqj8K&#34;&gt;Link to plnkr.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also available on GitHub, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nandotech/umgbeta&#34;&gt;https://github.com/nandotech/umgbeta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launches a page where you type any github username you’d like to look up and returns projects sorted by stars along with the user’s avatar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*7h_r_uTlUc68krRf.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also be able to view the source code. Feel free to make any comments! Special thanks again to Scott Allen &amp;amp; Pluralsight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with Angular 2.0 coming, I’ll bear with the growing pains. There’s a bright future ahead for this stack and developing with it is a joy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Priorities Over Feelings</title>
      <link>https://nandotech.github.io/post/2016-06-10-priorities-over-feelings/</link>

&lt;h4 id=&#34;let-s-be-honest&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;most-people-are-not-very-good-at-this&#34;&gt;Most  people are not very good at this.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, it almost sounds dumb, like some cliche you hear from motivational speakers on a regular basis. &lt;strong&gt;Far from that&lt;/strong&gt;, it is an extremely astute articulation of a decision one as an entrepreneur and a business owner has to consciously make on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a daily basis, we must choose to put our &lt;em&gt;priorities&lt;/em&gt; over our &lt;em&gt;feelings&lt;/em&gt;.  Again, not a difficult concept to grasp.  However, it is a much more difficult concept to truthfully embrace whole-heartedly because let&amp;rsquo;s face it: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/intense-emotions-and-strong-feelings/201012/it-or-not-emotions-will-drive-the-decisions-you&#34;&gt;humans are not very good at controlling emotion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://successyeti.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TSBB_Frustration-440x293.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Strong emotions&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we are.  Relegated to the endless tug-of-war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or are we?  After serious reflection I realized that there is absolutely no reason to be or stay a slave to your emotions like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had an extremely difficult client.  My company prides itself on providing excellent customer service, going so far as to even provide our regular clients slack channels where they have unfettered access to us pretty much &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found myself nearly having a stroke and moreover negatively impacting my relationship with my client (who luckily also happens to be a friend, or he probably would have fired me already) on a daily basis.  Every day I was allowing my feelings to get in the way of my priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that it is going to be easy.  As a matter of fact, I had to take some rather &lt;strong&gt;drastic&lt;/strong&gt; measures but in the end it has worked out for the best.  We&amp;rsquo;ve reached the end of the week&amp;ndash;neither one of us (my client or I) wants to kill each other and he has gotten better customer service this week than he has in several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering, what changed?  I put my PRIORITIES over my FEELINGS.  Thanks to the wonders of technology: &lt;em&gt;I shut down the Slack channel and deactivated my friend&amp;rsquo;s slack account&lt;/em&gt;.  He no longer has the ability to distract us while we&amp;rsquo;re working or frustrate me with questions that I must impulsively answer.  Impulsive in that I tended to overreact, so I  had to change the dynamic of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our relationship has never been better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Going From Zero to One</title>
      <link>https://nandotech.github.io/post/2016-02-27-going-from-zero-to-one/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>info@nandotech.com (Fernando Rodriguez)</author>
      <guid>https://nandotech.github.io/post/2016-02-27-going-from-zero-to-one/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chances are I’m also not the first person you’ve heard this from, either. This is one of the very few books that truly is a must-read for anyone who calls themselves a business owner, entrepreneur or anyone even considering the prospect of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out my Amazon Prime subscription came with a free few Audible credits. Naturally, the temptation of free being too much to resist, I grabbed a copy of Peter Thiel’s Zero to One.
Peter Thiel co-founded PayPal in 1998 with Max Levchin and later Elon Musk and served as its CEO before going on to co-found Palantir and many other successful investments and ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*xYzzIwDiflb5ndSD.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Zero to One&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened to the entire book in the last 30 hours and am preparing myself for a second listen. To say that Mr. Thiel provides sage advice to any entrepreneur or businessperson considering it is a gross understatement. Some of what you read (hear?) may sound a bit grandiose, but the author manages to have these great visions always be firmly rooted in really simple fundamental truths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book opens posing the contrarian question that he poses at every interview he has, “What very important truth do very few people agree with you on?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it. At once, the question asks you to identify an important truth (daunting, on its own) while adding that very few people agree with you on it. Outright asking someone to voice what is inherently an unpopular opinion by definition can be an uncomfortable question to ask. But an important one nonetheless.
Peter Thiel and Blake Masters provide us examples of good and bad answers to this question, as well as their own responses. Mr. Thiel postulates that monopolies are good for business while perfect competition stifles it. Something naturally opposed to what we are taught our entire lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer? We are on the verge of having a technically illiterate generation if we do not begin to close the tech skills gap immediately and teach computer programming as a core subject beginning in grade school. I haven’t exactly polled it. Does that qualify as unpopular? Is the idea that today’s system of education is failing our youth not something many people would agree with me on? I’m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one thing I am sure of. We must go from Zero to One.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are just 2 super geeks who blog here in our spare time because we love what we do. We are software developers and telephony solution experts in South Florida. What’s more, if our experiences and (sometimes) horror stories can entertain you, or better yet, help guide you through your next project then we feel like we’ve given back to the community and are no longer just consumers taking in information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formally, we are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nandotech.com&#34;&gt;NandoTech, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; Software developers and telephony solution experts. Also, a full service IT company located in South Florida, catering mostly to call centers and specializing in the .NET stack for our software. About mid-way through 2015 we decided NandoTech had something to offer the market that does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we are. Working gruelingly long weeks, working all hours of the night, always concerned about customer x, y or z and that they have everything they need for their business to operate smoothly. And we absolutely love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be posting relevant articles mostly pertaining to software development, startups, VoIP/Telephony systems as well as ASP.NET MVC &amp;amp; web dev. As a general rule, there is nothing that we DON’T do–we just have our preferences and opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preferences and opinions which by the way are very much our own, and do not necessarily reflect those of NandoTech, Inc or any of its shareholders.
At NandoTech, we are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fernando-rodriguez-president-ceo-software-development&#34;&gt;Fernando Rodriguez, President/CEO — Software Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;arron-mayers-vice-president-technical-development&#34;&gt;Arron Mayers — Vice President — Technical Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;nandotech-inc&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;NandoTech, Inc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we are just 2 super geeks trying to help others like us.
Hope you enjoy the blog. Our passion to always keep learning new things keeps us inspired, and your support just might keep us fed.&lt;/p&gt;
