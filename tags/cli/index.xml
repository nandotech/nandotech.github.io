      <description>Happy New Year to everyone and my apologies for the long hiatus between posts! Will definitely be keeping it more regular with posts going forward, so I decided for this post I&amp;rsquo;d put together a fully working application that actually solves a business problem (you could actually take this code and use it yourself!).
Since my last NancyFX post about async functions the team has dropped another update! We are now on Nancy 2.</description>

      <description>I recently downloaded and upgraded to .NET Core 1.1.0 which comes along with updated CLI tools, 1.0.0-preview3-004056. This new version reflects the CLI tools that are being used for the new .csproj project system which does away with project.json that many of us grew to know and love.
Of course, this has been a long time coming and the announcement that Microsoft would be moving back to .csproj was announced way back in March or so.</description>
