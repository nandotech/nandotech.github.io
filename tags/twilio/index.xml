      <description>In the spirit of open source (and to pay it something better than lip service) NandoTech has published our first open source utility that we are using in-house. The application in and of itself is nothing special and doesn&amp;rsquo;t do anything particuarly complicated, but it solves an important problem for us while having the added benefit of possibly helping someone else with a similar problem.
   NandoTech Twilio          The utility we&amp;rsquo;ve released is a Twilio Call Importer which essentially just goes out and grabs all SIP call logs from Twilio and then saves them in batches of 1,000 to [SQL Server](), but there are serveral guides showing how you can configure Dapper for other databases very easily around the web.</description>
