      <description>It has been an awfully long time in between blog posts. The past year has resulted in a slew of unforeseen changes that I would never have imagined. After my post regarding Learning From Failure, I was ultimately forced to make an extremely tough decision and effectively shutter NandoTech, Inc. as an independent entity. The company was absorbed by a client whom also provided me with full-time work. Since then, life has been quite the whirlwind and rollercoaster ride&amp;ndash;such that I realize my last blog post was over a year ago.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me, you constantly are finding more and more tasks that require your attention. To make matters worse, the industry definition of &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo; is still evolving itself, quickly becoming ubiquitous with &amp;ldquo;a litle bit of everything&amp;rdquo; in the process.
Like a breath of fresh air, ZEIT is a cloud service that allows near-mindless deployment of javascript &amp;amp; node.js apps. Much thanks probably also belongs to Scott Hanselman and his ever-tinkering soul who published &amp;ldquo;ZEIT now deployments of open source ASP.</description>

      <description>Microsoft has finally dropped Visual Studio 2017 with a bevy of new features and also relocated all our .NET Core docs over to https://docs.microsoft.com/. I, for one, had downloaded Visual Studio 2017 RC quite a while back and due to some horrible judgement and lack of forethought I actually had been using the IDE almost full-time for my .NET projects. I basically used it for everything I could and if I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make the transition, I simply used Visual Studio Code.</description>

      <description>The last month or so has easily been the most challenging, trying time of my life. I think I saw the writing on the wall long ago, I just refused to accept it. After almost 2 years being a completely independent entity (without me consulting full-time), I had to make the incredibly difficult decision of shuttering NandoTech, Inc operations (new business/projects) and taken on a new full-time consulting position for who was already our largest client by size &amp;amp; volume.</description>

      <description>Happy New Year to everyone and my apologies for the long hiatus between posts! Will definitely be keeping it more regular with posts going forward, so I decided for this post I&amp;rsquo;d put together a fully working application that actually solves a business problem (you could actually take this code and use it yourself!).
Since my last NancyFX post about async functions the team has dropped another update! We are now on Nancy 2.</description>

      <description>I recently downloaded and upgraded to .NET Core 1.1.0 which comes along with updated CLI tools, 1.0.0-preview3-004056. This new version reflects the CLI tools that are being used for the new .csproj project system which does away with project.json that many of us grew to know and love.
Of course, this has been a long time coming and the announcement that Microsoft would be moving back to .csproj was announced way back in March or so.</description>

      <description>These days, it seems like there are more and more people out there &amp;ldquo;learning to code&amp;rdquo;. TL;DR - Book list is at the bottom. Every day there is another boot camp, code school, or one of many scores of opportunistic business ventures opening up. Many claim to not only teach you this amazing magical skill that is programming, but they will also magically imbue you with the personality needed to get past the HR Manager.</description>

      <description>Next week I hope to continue our series on the NancyFX framework for building web applications. For our next post I hope to cover Routing as well as passing arguments via query string, body and how that all works within Nancy. As a quick break, this week I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to put together a compilation of .NET Core resources that may help anyone at any .NET skill level jump in and find the information they are looking for.</description>

      <description>This post will serve as a follow-up to our earlier NancyFX exploration. A few weeks ago, I posted Building an (awesome) API with NancyFX 2.0 + Dapper where we covered all the basics of Nancy and running on .NET Core. If you have not read our previous post, not to worry, there will be very little to no overlap between the 2 posts. Here, we will focus in on and deep dive into the use of Async Modules in NancyFX as well as how the Before and After action method hooks work.</description>

      <description>In the spirit of open source (and to pay it something better than lip service) NandoTech has published our first open source utility that we are using in-house. The application in and of itself is nothing special and doesn&amp;rsquo;t do anything particuarly complicated, but it solves an important problem for us while having the added benefit of possibly helping someone else with a similar problem.
   NandoTech Twilio          The utility we&amp;rsquo;ve released is a Twilio Call Importer which essentially just goes out and grabs all SIP call logs from Twilio and then saves them in batches of 1,000 to [SQL Server](), but there are serveral guides showing how you can configure Dapper for other databases very easily around the web.</description>

      <description>NancyFX &amp;amp; Dapper are so hot right now. Naturally, I had to put them together. I am a huge fan and follower of .NET Core and the entire open source movement going on inside Microsoft and really what seems like the world over. More and more companies, big and small are open sourcing projects as the default rather than the exception. ASP.NET Core looks extremely promising, but I was always a fan of NancyFX and wanted to try it out.</description>

      <description>PSA: Skip to the TL;DR for list of resources
So, due to forces of nature beyond our control (specifically Hurricane Matthew), the Angular 2 Workshop we were registered for this Thursday &amp;amp; Friday, October 6th &amp;amp; 7th with both John Papa and Dan Wahlin was cancelled. Thankfully for us South Floridians, Hurricane Matthew narrowly avoided a direct hit with us southernmost residents and the tri-county area of Dade, Broward &amp;amp; Palm Beach was mostly unaffected.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s something whimsical about Greenfield applications. The feeling of complete freedom over architecture decisions. The drawn out, sometimes heated debates concerning the most minute of details. Javascript frameworks. React, no&amp;ndash;let&amp;rsquo;s use Angular! Better yet, let&amp;rsquo;s use Anguar 2 because that&amp;rsquo;s got to be better than 1, right?
All kidding aside, the feeling of freedom of laying out and choosing technologies and how they will be distributed, hosted &amp;amp; supported is pretty awesome.</description>

      <description>This past week marked the first official patch update since .NET Core&amp;rsquo;s initial release. Naturally, the version number we have jumped up to is 1.0.1. If you spent any time with the beta&amp;rsquo;s and rc1-8, let me forewarn you now: DO NOT go open project.json and edit every single reference up to 1.0.1.
Firstly, in a basic Hello World or a Console App, the declaration the .NET Core version has changed very slightly.</description>

      <description>Let me start off by saying unequivocally and without any shadow of a doubt: I am not a networking expert. Although I understand all the constructs of the web and most all of the requisite information pertaining to how computers and the internet communicate as well as the nuances of local and public networks.
My real deep protocol knowledge extends mostly into the realm of software development and how bits/bytes are consumed over the wire.</description>

      <description>I recently took the Pluralsight course AngularJS: Get Started by Scott Allen.
If you want the tl;dr early, it’s totally worth it and really starts to give you a pretty decent working knowledge of AngularJS, and what’s better yet: you build an actual working application in the process.
I did my own tweaks with the UI, minor deviations as well as selecting my own theme, but otherwise it’s pretty cool to see just how easy it is to create beautiful AngularJS apps tied to an API that turns standard JSON responses with little heavy lifting.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest. Most people are not very good at this. At first, it almost sounds dumb, like some cliche you hear from motivational speakers on a regular basis. Far from that, it is an extremely astute articulation of a decision one as an entrepreneur and a business owner has to consciously make on a daily basis.
On a daily basis, we must choose to put our priorities over our feelings.</description>

      <description>Chances are I’m also not the first person you’ve heard this from, either. This is one of the very few books that truly is a must-read for anyone who calls themselves a business owner, entrepreneur or anyone even considering the prospect of it.
Turns out my Amazon Prime subscription came with a free few Audible credits. Naturally, the temptation of free being too much to resist, I grabbed a copy of Peter Thiel’s Zero to One.</description>
